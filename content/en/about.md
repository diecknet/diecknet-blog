![Hey!](/images/hi-there.jpg "Hey! ðŸ‘‹")

## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andreas Dieckmann and I'm from Hamburg, Germany. I like technology, IT, coding and Open Source. And nature, forests, lakes and video games.

I work as a self employed IT-Consultant with focus on IT-Security, Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure. But I also work with other technologies. Except of this website here, I'm also running a (German) [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@diecknet).
