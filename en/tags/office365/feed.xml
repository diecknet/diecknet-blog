      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep it short: If you want to manage Exchange Online via Azure Automation, Managed Identities is what you should use (as of early 2023).
Legacy approach In the past, RunAs Accounts or Plaintext Credentials (ðŸ¤¢) were also commonly used for this purpose, but this is now considered deprecated. RunAs accounts will be discontinued by fall 2023. And I don&amp;rsquo;t have to say anything about plaintext passwords, do I?</description>

      <description>You can register for a free Office 365/Microsoft 365 Tenant to try it out. Or you can add trial licenses to your existing tenant. You&amp;rsquo;ll get a 30 day trial phase. The trial contains 25 user licenses. After the expiration of the trial phase, you can delete the tenant or extend the trial. Alternatively you can purchase licenses to continue to use the services. A list of links to the trial licenes is further below in this article.</description>

      <description>When the first users logged into Office 365 with his iPhone to sync his Contacts and Calendar, he got this dialogue:
Need admin approval Apple Internet Accounts Apple Internet Accounts needs permission to access resources in your organization that only an admin can grant. Please ask an admin to grant permission to this app before you can use it.
By the way, the app used to be called &amp;ldquo;iOS Accounts&amp;rdquo; and was apparently renamed in early 2020.</description>

      <description>At the end of the Hybrid Configuration Wizard (HCW) I received the following warning message:
HCW8064 - The HCW has completed, but was not able to perform the OAuth portion of your Hybrid configuration. If you need features that rely on OAuth, you can try running the HCW again or manually configure OAuth using these manual steps.
The link &amp;ldquo;more information&amp;rdquo; links to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3089172/hcw-has-completed-but-was-not-able-to-perform-the-oauth-portion-of-you. If you lookup what OAuth is used for, this article comes up.</description>

      <description>Outlook Certificate Warning after Office 365 Migration
Security Alert: svr1.example.com
The security certificate has expired or is not valid yet
I recently received a request from a customer who still received certificate warnings (expired certificate) for the old Exchange Server after migrating to Office 365. Since I was not involved in the migration, I had to get an overview first:
The On-Premise Exchange Server 2010 was still online - of course, otherwise a certificate warning would hardly have appeared.</description>
