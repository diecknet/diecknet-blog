      <description>You can using Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing licenses to get Dial-In phone numbers for your meetings. The license is needed per user that creates the meeting invites.
The phone number in the meeting invite is based on the UsageLocation attribute of the user - once when the user gets enabled for Audio Conferencing. So even if you fix a wrong UsageLocation, the user will still have the old dial-in number assigned.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re asking yourself &amp;ldquo;How long are deleted Teams channels retained?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;For how long can I restore a deleted Teams channel?&amp;rdquo; you can find the answer relatively quick. But mostly the original source in the Microsoft documentation is missing.
Answer Deleted Microsoft Teams Channels are retained for 30 days.
Official Source In https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/limits-specifications-teams#teams-and-channels under the table Teams and channels in footnote 4 it&amp;rsquo;s stated:
Deleted channels can be restored within 30 days.</description>
