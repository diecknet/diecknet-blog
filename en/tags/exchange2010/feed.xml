&lt;p&gt;Outlook Certificate Warning after Office 365 Migration&lt;br&gt;
Security Alert: svr1.example.com&lt;br&gt;
The security certificate has expired or is not valid yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently received a request from a customer who still received certificate warnings (expired certificate) for the old Exchange Server after migrating to Office 365. Since I was not involved in the migration, I had to get an overview first:&lt;br&gt;
The On-Premise Exchange Server 2010 was still online - of course, otherwise a certificate warning would hardly have appeared. However, not all users received this message. This affected migrated users as well as users whose mailboxes were created directly in Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
