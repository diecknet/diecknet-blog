      <description>Normally when a user leaves the Company their OneDrive for Business site gets automatically delegated to their manager. That means the manager gets SharePoint Site Collection admin rights to the OneDrive site of their subordinate.
Checking and Changing Access Delegation ⚠️ Access Delegation is enabled as default. The setting can be found and changed here:
Go to More features in the new SharePoint admin center, and sign in with an account that has admin permissions for your organization.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to retrieve the Timezone setting of a Sharepoint Online Site via PowerShell. Apparently there is not much good info publicly available. I looked for a way to use with the standard SPO PowerShell module named Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell.
There are some infos online about using the PNPOnline Module, but that was not practical in my case. There are even some really annoying articles out, that claim to to provide a PowerShell way.</description>
